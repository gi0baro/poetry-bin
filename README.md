# poetry-bin

This project builds [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) Python dependency management tool into a binary executable using [PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer).

The aim is to have a Poetry instance which is fully independant of the local Python environment.

> **Note:** due to patches implemented over Poetry components, this build might introduce unwanted bugs over Poetry project, use at your own risk.
