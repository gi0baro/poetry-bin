# The `pyproject.toml` file

The `tool.poetry` section of the `pyproject.toml` file is composed of multiple sections.

## name

The name of the package. **Required**

This should be a valid name as defined by [PEP 508](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#names).


```toml
name = "my-package"
```

## version

The version of the package. **Required**

This should be a valid [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) string.

```toml
version = "0.1.0"
```

{{% note %}}

If you would like to use semantic versioning for your project, please see
[here]({{< relref "libraries#versioning" >}}).

{{% /note %}}

## description

A short description of the package. **Required**

```toml
description = "A short description of the package."
```

## license

The license of the package.

The recommended notation for the most common licenses is (alphabetical):

* Apache-2.0
* BSD-2-Clause
* BSD-3-Clause
* BSD-4-Clause
* GPL-2.0-only
* GPL-2.0-or-later
* GPL-3.0-only
* GPL-3.0-or-later
* LGPL-2.1-only
* LGPL-2.1-or-later
* LGPL-3.0-only
* LGPL-3.0-or-later
* MIT

Optional, but it is highly recommended to supply this.
More identifiers are listed at the [SPDX Open Source License Registry](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

```toml
license = "MIT"
```
{{% note %}}
If your project is proprietary and does not use a specific licence, you can set this value as `Proprietary`.
{{% /note %}}

## authors

The authors of the package. **Required**

This is a list of authors and should contain at least one author. Authors must be in the form `name <email>`.

```toml
authors = [
    "Sébastien Eustace <sebastien@eustace.io>",
]
```

## maintainers

The maintainers of the package. **Optional**

This is a list of maintainers and should be distinct from authors. Maintainers may contain an email and be in the form `name <email>`.

```toml
maintainers = [
    "John Smith <johnsmith@example.org>",
    "Jane Smith <janesmith@example.org>",
]
```

## readme

A path, or list of paths corresponding to the README file(s) of the package.
**Optional**

The file(s) can be of any format, but if you intend to publish to PyPI keep the
[recommendations for a PyPI-friendly README](
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme/) in
mind. README paths are implicitly relative to `pyproject.toml`.

The contents of the README file(s) are used to populate the [Description
field](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#description-optional)
of your distribution's metadata (similar to `long_description` in setuptools).
When multiple files are specified they are concatenated with newlines.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
# ...
readme = "README.md"
```

```toml
[tool.poetry]
# ...
readme = ["docs/README1.md", "docs/README2.md"]
```

## homepage

An URL to the website of the project. **Optional**

```toml
homepage = "https://python-poetry.org/"
```

## repository

An URL to the repository of the project. **Optional**

```toml
repository = "https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry"
```

## documentation

An URL to the documentation of the project. **Optional**

```toml
documentation = "https://python-poetry.org/docs/"
```

## keywords

A list of keywords that the package is related to. **Optional**

```toml
keywords = ["packaging", "poetry"]
```

## classifiers

A list of PyPI [trove classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) that describe the project. **Optional**

```toml
[tool.poetry]
# ...
classifiers = [
    "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools",
    "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules"
]
```

{{% note %}}
Note that Python classifiers are still automatically added for you and are determined by your `python` requirement.

The `license` property will also set the License classifier automatically.

## packages

A list of packages and modules to include in the final distribution.

If your project structure differs from the standard one supported by `poetry`,
you can specify the packages you want to include in the final distribution.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
# ...
packages = [
    { include = "my_package" },
    { include = "extra_package/**/*.py" },
]
```

If your package is stored inside a "lib" directory, you must specify it:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
# ...
packages = [
    { include = "my_package", from = "lib" },
]
```

If you want to restrict a package to a specific [build](#build) format you can specify
it by using `format`:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
# ...
packages = [
    { include = "my_package" },
    { include = "my_other_package", format = "sdist" },
]
```

From now on, only the `sdist` build archive will include the `my_other_package` package.

{{% note %}}
Using `packages` disables the package auto-detection feature meaning you have to
**explicitly** specify the "default" package.

For instance, if you have a package named `my_package` and you want to also include
another package named `extra_package`, you will need to specify `my_package` explicitly:

```toml
packages = [
    { include = "my_package" },
    { include = "extra_package" },
]
```
{{% /note %}}

{{% note %}}
Poetry is clever enough to detect Python subpackages.

Thus, you only have to specify the directory where your root package resides.
{{% /note %}}

## include and exclude

A list of patterns that will be included in the final package.

You can explicitly specify to Poetry that a set of globs should be ignored or included for the purposes of packaging.
The globs specified in the exclude field identify a set of files that are not included when a package is built.

If a VCS is being used for a package, the exclude field will be seeded with the VCS’ ignore settings (`.gitignore` for git for example).

{{% note %}}
Explicitly declaring entries in `include` will negate VCS' ignore settings.
{{% /note %}}

```toml
[tool.poetry]
# ...
include = ["CHANGELOG.md"]
```

You can also specify the formats for which these patterns have to be included, as shown here:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
# ...
include = [
    { path = "tests", format = "sdist" },
    { path = "for_wheel.txt", format = ["sdist", "wheel"] }
]
```

If no format is specified, it will default to include both `sdist` and `wheel`.

```toml
exclude = ["my_package/excluded.py"]
```

## dependencies and dependency groups

Poetry is configured to look for dependencies on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) by default.
Only the name and a version string are required in this case.

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
requests = "^2.13.0"
```

If you want to use a [private repository]({{< relref "repositories#using-a-private-repository" >}}),
you can add it to your `pyproject.toml` file, like so:

```toml
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "private"
url = "http://example.com/simple"
```

If you have multiple repositories configured, you can explicitly tell poetry where to look for a specific package:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
requests = { version = "^2.13.0", source = "private" }
```

{{% note %}}
Be aware that declaring the python version for which your package
is compatible is mandatory:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.7"
```
{{% /note %}}

You can organize your dependencies in [groups]({{< relref "managing-dependencies#dependency-groups" >}})
to manage them in a more granular way.

```toml
[tool.poetry.group.test.dependencies]
pytest = "*"

[tool.poetry.group.docs.dependencies]
mkdocs = "*"
```

See [Dependency groups]({{< relref "managing-dependencies#dependency-groups" >}}) for a more in-depth look
at how to manage dependency groups and [Dependency specification]({{< relref "dependency-specification" >}})
for more information on other keys and specifying version ranges.

## `scripts`

This section describes the scripts or executables that will be installed when installing the package

```toml
[tool.poetry.scripts]
my_package_cli = 'my_package.console:run'
```

Here, we will have the `my_package_cli` script installed which will execute the `run` function in the `console` module in the `my_package` package.

To specify a script that [depends on an extra](#extras), you may provide an entry as an inline table:

```toml
[tool.poetry.scripts]
devtest = { callable = "mypackage:test.run_tests", extras = ["test"] }
```

{{% note %}}
When a script is added or updated, run `poetry install` to make them available in the project's virtualenv.
{{% /note %}}

## `extras`

Poetry supports extras to allow expression of:

* optional dependencies, which enhance a package, but are not required; and
* clusters of optional dependencies.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "awesome"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
# These packages are mandatory and form the core of this package’s distribution.
mandatory = "^1.0"

# A list of all of the optional dependencies, some of which are included in the
# below `extras`. They can be opted into by apps.
psycopg2 = { version = "^2.9", optional = true }
mysqlclient = { version = "^1.3", optional = true }

[tool.poetry.extras]
mysql = ["mysqlclient"]
pgsql = ["psycopg2"]
databases = ["mysqlclient", "psycopg2"]
```

When installing packages with Poetry, you can specify extras by using the `-E|--extras` option:

```bash
poetry install --extras "mysql pgsql"
poetry install -E mysql -E pgsql
```

Or, you can install all extras with the `--all-extras` option:

```bash
poetry install --all-extras
```

When installing or specifying Poetry-built packages, the extras defined in this section can be activated
as described in [PEP 508](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#extras).

For example, when installing the package using `pip`, the dependencies required by
the `databases` extra can be installed as shown below.

```bash
pip install awesome[databases]
```

{{% note %}}
The dependencies specified for each `extra` must already be defined as project dependencies.

Dependencies listed in [dependency groups]({{< relref "managing-dependencies#dependency-groups" >}}) cannot be specified as extras.
{{% /note %}}


## `plugins`

Poetry supports arbitrary plugins which work similarly to
[setuptools entry points](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html).
To match the example in the setuptools documentation, you would use the following:

```toml
[tool.poetry.plugins] # Optional super table

[tool.poetry.plugins."blogtool.parsers"]
".rst" = "some_module:SomeClass"
```

## `urls`

In addition to the basic urls (`homepage`, `repository` and `documentation`), you can specify
any custom url in the `urls` section.

```toml
[tool.poetry.urls]
"Bug Tracker" = "https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues"
```

If you publish your package on PyPI, they will appear in the `Project Links` section.

## Poetry and PEP-517

[PEP-517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) introduces a standard way
to define alternative build systems to build a Python project.

Poetry is compliant with PEP-517, by providing a lightweight core library,
so if you use Poetry to manage your Python project you should reference
it in the `build-system` section of the `pyproject.toml` file like so:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

{{% note %}}
When using the `new` or `init` command this section will be automatically added.
{{% /note %}}

{{% note %}}
If your `pyproject.toml` file still references `poetry` directly as a build backend,
you should update it to reference `poetry-core` instead.
{{% /note %}}
